# Open Traceability
A repository for storing code for the open source traceability libraries developed by IFT. 

## Current Supported Programming Languages / Frameworks
We currently support the following:

    - .NET 7 (supported)
    - .NET Standard 2.0 (coming soon)

- Java (actively being translated and coming soon)

*If you want us to support your language, please reach out to us so we can put on our to-do list.*

## How to use?
Each language has it's own folder and Read Me file. Navigate to the language you want to use and read the Read Me file there.
